# @saas-maker/feedback

A React feedback widget with optional screenshots and Pinpoint page-element
context. The default SaaS Maker path is the hosted submission service; callback
and URL ingestion remain explicit escape hatches.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @saas-maker/feedback
```

## Quick start: hosted service

Create a project in the private feedback inbox at app.sassmaker.com, then use
its public submission key in the browser:

```tsx
import { FeedbackWidget } from '@saas-maker/feedback'
import '@saas-maker/feedback/dist/index.css'

export function AppFeedback() {
  return <FeedbackWidget projectKey="feedback_public_example" />
}
```

The public key can only identify the destination project. It is not a secret
and must not grant inbox access. The widget sends one `POST` to
`https://api.sassmaker.com/v1/feedback` with the key in `X-Project-Key` and a
multipart body (`feedback` JSON plus an optional `screenshot` file).

## Quick start: callback

Use `onSubmit` when your product already owns storage:

```tsx
import { FeedbackWidget } from '@saas-maker/feedback'
import '@saas-maker/feedback/dist/index.css'

export function AppFeedback() {
  return (
    <FeedbackWidget
      onSubmit={async (feedback) => {
        await fetch('/api/feedback', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            ...feedback,
            screenshot: undefined,
          }),
        })

        // feedback.screenshot is the original File. Upload it separately if needed.
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

`onSubmit` may send an email, create an issue, call an authenticated API, or
write to any system your product already uses.

## Quick start: ingestion URL

Use `ingestionUrl` when your caller-owned endpoint accepts the package's stable
multipart contract:

```tsx
import { FeedbackWidget } from '@saas-maker/feedback'
import '@saas-maker/feedback/dist/index.css'

export function AppFeedback() {
  return <FeedbackWidget ingestionUrl="/api/feedback" />
}
```

The destination may be a relative path or an absolute HTTP(S) URL. Cross-origin
destinations must allow the request through CORS. The package sends no cookies,
authorization, project key, or other credentials. Use `onSubmit` instead when
the destination requires authentication or a different payload.

Configure exactly one of `projectKey`, `onSubmit`, and `ingestionUrl`.

### Endpoint contract

URL mode sends one `POST` with a `FormData` body:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `feedback` | JSON string containing the submission without `screenshot` |
| `screenshot` | Original image file when supplied; otherwise omitted |

Hosted mode uses the same multipart fields against `/v1/feedback`, plus the
publishable `X-Project-Key` header. The widget displays success only after a 2xx
response. A network failure or non-2xx response keeps the form data available
and shows an error. Requests are never retried automatically.

## Payload

```ts
interface FeedbackSubmission {
  type: 'bug' | 'feature' | 'feedback'
  title: string
  description: string
  email?: string
  name?: string
  anchor?: {
    selector: string
    tag: string | null
    text: string
    source: string | null
    url: string
  }
  screenshot?: File
  page: {
    url: string
    title: string
  }
}
```

The success state appears only after the selected destination succeeds.
Callback errors and URL ingestion failures are shown in the form.

## Interaction and accessibility

The floating trigger opens a right-side feedback panel on larger screens and a
full-height sheet on small screens. The panel opens with focus in the form,
keeps keyboard focus inside while open, closes with Escape or the close button,
and returns focus to the trigger. Type choices expose their selected state to
assistive technology; controls have visible keyboard focus and touch targets of
at least 44 pixels. Motion is reduced when the visitor prefers reduced motion.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `onSubmit` | `(feedback) => void \| Promise<void>` | XOR | Product-owned submission callback |
| `ingestionUrl` | `string` | XOR | Caller-owned HTTP(S) multipart endpoint |
| `projectKey` | `string` | XOR | Public key for the hosted SaaS Maker feedback service |
| `apiBaseUrl` | `string` | api.sassmaker.com | Hosted API override for local/self-hosted use |
| `userEmail` | `string` | — | Pre-filled email |
| `userName` | `string` | — | Pre-filled name |
| `requireEmail` | `boolean` | `false` | Require an email before submission |
| `types` | `FeedbackType[]` | bug, feature, feedback | Allowed types |
| `position` | bottom-right or bottom-left | bottom-right | Trigger position |
| `theme` | light, dark, or auto | auto | Color theme |
| `accentColor` | `string` | `#1464ff` | Accent color |
| `triggerText` | `string` | Feedback | Trigger label |
| `enablePointing` | `boolean` | `true` | Enable Pinpoint |
| `pageContext` | `FeedbackPageContext` | browser page | Override submitted page URL and title |
| `requireConsent` | `boolean` | `false` | Require confirmation before submission |
| `privacyUrl` | `string` | — | Link from the consent disclosure |

## Pinpoint

Pinpoint lets the user click a page element. The submission receives a selector,
visible text, page path, and source hint when React development metadata or a
`data-source` attribute is available. Nothing is submitted until the user
explicitly sends the form.

## Screenshots

JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP files up to 5 MB can be attached. Callback mode receives
the original `File`; hosted and URL modes send it in the `screenshot` multipart
field. The package does not retain it.

## Privacy

Your product controls the endpoint, authentication, destination, and retention
policy. Disclose collected feedback, identity fields, screenshots, and
page-element context in your own privacy policy where appropriate. Never place
a secret in client-side widget configuration.

When `requireConsent` is enabled, the widget requires an unchecked-by-default
confirmation before sending and can link to the product's privacy policy.
Shared footer embeds disable Pinpoint and submit only the origin and path as
page context, omitting query strings and fragments. Email, name, and screenshots
remain optional and are sent only when the visitor supplies them.

The shared footer first renders a small accessible launcher and downloads this
React widget only after the visitor activates it. If the host page already has
an element marked `data-feedback-widget`, the shared launcher stays hidden; a
late React mount is also detected while the page hydrates.

## Compatibility

- React 18 and React 19
- Modern browsers with `File`, `URL.createObjectURL`, and DOM APIs
- Client-rendered components
