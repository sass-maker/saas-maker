# GitStat

GitStat shows the shape of a developer's public GitHub footprint, not merely a contribution count. Enter any GitHub username and the dashboard aggregates activity across public repositories and organizations.

## What it answers

- Where are commits and line changes distributed?
- Which repositories and organizations receive sustained work?
- How do additions, deletions, net change, and code churn vary over time?
- What do pull-request, issue, collaboration, language, cadence, and inactivity patterns show?
- What sampled public commit metadata suggests AI-agent involvement?

GitStat keeps those dimensions separate so activity is not collapsed into one misleading productivity score. Repository links remain available as the underlying evidence.

## Current access

GitStat is free and public. No account, subscription, or payment is required. The current product analyzes public GitHub data; it does not currently expose the earlier optional OAuth/private-repository connection.

GitHub responses are processed in the browser and cached on the current device for one hour. GitStat has no user account store. Microsoft Clarity measures site interaction, and the username field is masked before collection. If optional server-side App Health monitoring is configured, it receives only the method, fixed API route, response status, and duration; it does not receive usernames, repository names, query values, headers, or request/response bodies.

## Boundaries

AI involvement is an inference from sampled public commit metadata, not proof of authorship. Line counts are evidence of change volume, not an automatic measure of value or developer performance. Private repository activity is outside the current public surface.

## Start

Open [GitStat](https://git.significanthobbies.com/) and enter a GitHub username.
