# Collection tooling

This is SaaS Maker shared collection tooling, formerly the standalone Slow SERP repo. Source history: sarthakagrawal927 / Significant-Hobbies/slow-serp @ `ae8662f`. It is not a hosted service or a CAPTCHA bypass. Google search availability is not established: upstream HTTP 429 was seen, and search needs authorized outbound IP capacity.

It provides a local scraping API and scheduled crawler. It uses bounded HTTP fetching first, then automatically falls back to the machine's installed **Google Chrome** only when rendering is required.

It has three entry points:

- `pnpm start` exposes the paced Google search API.
- `pnpm run jobs` collects normalized public job listings into dated JSON and CSV.
- `pnpm run crawl` runs the general target registry, capturing ordinary pages or invoking the jobs extractor as configured.

This is intentionally not a CAPTCHA solver or an aggressive crawler. If Google returns a consent, unusual-traffic, or challenge page, the API stops with an `upstream_blocked` error so the profile or egress can be checked by a human.

## Design

- Real installed Chrome, not Playwright's bundled Chromium.
- Fast HTTP-first extraction with bounded response sizes and streaming reads.
- ETag, Last-Modified, and content-hash reuse between scheduled runs.
- Configurable headful/headless persistent context.
- One paced queue per Google-search instance.
- Bounded browser concurrency with one active page per hostname.
- Optional blocking of images, fonts, media, stylesheets, and service workers for lower background resource use.
- Proxy credentials supplied only at runtime.
- API-key authentication when the HTTP service is exposed beyond localhost.
- No automatic CAPTCHA interaction.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer.
- Google Chrome installed.
- A display only when `SCRAPER_HEADLESS=false`. Headless scheduled crawls do not require one.

## Install and verify

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sass-maker/saas-maker.git
cd saas-maker
cd tooling/collect
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm test
pnpm run doctor
```

Run the general registry or the dedicated jobs collector:

```bash
SCRAPER_HEADLESS=true SCRAPER_BLOCK_RESOURCES=true pnpm run crawl
SCRAPER_HEADLESS=true SCRAPER_BLOCK_RESOURCES=true pnpm run jobs
```

## General targets

The general crawler reads `targets/default.json`. A target can capture an ordinary page:

```json
{
  "name": "Example page",
  "url": "https://example.com/",
  "extractor": "page"
}
```

Targets default to `"transport": "auto"`. Set it to `"http"` to forbid browser fallback or `"browser"` when a site always requires JavaScript or a persistent session.

Public APIs and feeds can use `"extractor": "json"` or `"extractor": "text"`; these use HTTP transport exclusively.

Or it can invoke the jobs adapter with URL allow-patterns:

```json
{
  "name": "Example careers",
  "company": "Example",
  "url": "https://example.com/careers",
  "extractor": "jobs",
  "jobUrlIncludes": ["example.com/careers/"]
}
```

Each crawl writes `data/crawls/latest.json` plus a gzip-compressed timestamped run. A failed target is recorded without discarding successful targets. Override the registry or output directory with `SCRAPER_TARGETS_FILE` and `SCRAPER_OUTPUT_DIR`.

## Background operation on macOS

The bundled LaunchAgent runs `pnpm run crawl` immediately and every six hours. It uses headless Chrome, three concurrent target pages, resource blocking, `caffeinate` during each run, and local log files. No credentials are embedded in the agent.

The scheduled crawler uses its own Chrome profile so it cannot collide with an independently running API service.

```bash
pnpm run macos:validate
pnpm run macos:install
pnpm run macos:status
```

Results appear under `data/crawls/`; logs appear under `logs/`. Keep the Mac powered and connected to the network. To stop and remove the background job:

```bash
pnpm run macos:uninstall
```

## Google search API

Run a direct smoke test or start the local service:

```bash
pnpm run smoke -- "best mechanical keyboards"
SCRAPER_API_KEY='replace-with-a-strong-random-value' pnpm start
```

The service binds to `127.0.0.1:8787` by default. Keep that default and put an authenticated TLS reverse proxy in front of it, or deliberately set a private-network bind address.

- `GET /health` reports readiness, queue depth, pacing, and whether a proxy is configured; it never returns proxy credentials.
- `POST /v1/search` accepts `q`, `num` (1–10), `start` (0–90), `hl`, and `gl`.

Example request:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/search \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $SCRAPER_API_KEY" \
  --data '{"q":"playwright persistent context","num":5,"hl":"en","gl":"us"}'
```

## Runtime configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CHROME_EXECUTABLE` | auto-detected | Absolute Google Chrome executable path |
| `SCRAPER_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | HTTP bind address |
| `SCRAPER_PORT` | `8787` | HTTP port |
| `SCRAPER_API_KEY` | unset | Bearer token; required when exposed |
| `SCRAPER_PROFILE_DIR` | `work/chrome-profile` | Persistent Chrome profile directory |
| `SCRAPER_HEADLESS` | `false` | Run Chrome without visible windows |
| `SCRAPER_BLOCK_RESOURCES` | `false` | Skip nonessential browser resources |
| `SCRAPER_BROWSER_CONCURRENCY` | `3` | Concurrent browser fallbacks, capped at 8 |
| `SCRAPER_HTTP_CONCURRENCY` | `12` | Concurrent HTTP targets, capped at 64 |
| `SCRAPER_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS` | `15000` | HTTP-first timeout before fallback |
| `SCRAPER_HTTP_RETRIES` | `2` | Transient HTTP/network retries |
| `SCRAPER_HTTP_RETRY_BASE_MS` | `500` | Exponential backoff base delay |
| `SCRAPER_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` | `5000000` | Maximum buffered HTML response size |
| `SCRAPER_HTTP_CACHE_FILE` | `work/http-cache.json` | Conditional-request and content cache |
| `SCRAPER_USER_AGENT` | `slow-serp/0.2 (...)` | HTTP transport user agent |
| `SCRAPER_TARGETS_FILE` | `targets/default.json` | General crawler registry |
| `SCRAPER_OUTPUT_DIR` | `data/crawls` | General crawler output directory |
| `SCRAPER_PROXY_SERVER` | unset | Proxy endpoint, such as `http://host:port` |
| `SCRAPER_PROXY_USERNAME` | unset | Proxy username |
| `SCRAPER_PROXY_PASSWORD` | unset | Proxy password |
| `SCRAPER_MIN_DELAY_MS` | `30000` | Minimum delay between Google searches |

| `SCRAPER_NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT_MS` | `45000` | Navigation timeout |
| `SCRAPER_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` | `100` | Maximum queued Google searches |
| `SCRAPER_LOCALE` | `en-US` | Chrome locale |
| `SCRAPER_TIMEZONE` | `UTC` | Chrome timezone |

On a Linux host, set `SCRAPER_HEADLESS=true`. If visible Chrome is required, run under `xvfb-run` while keeping headless mode disabled.

Keep secret values in the machine's process manager or secret store. They are never needed in a checked-in file.
