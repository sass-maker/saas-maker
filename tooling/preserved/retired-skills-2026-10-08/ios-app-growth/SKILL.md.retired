# iOS App Growth

Build an evidence-backed growth system, not a promise that ads will print money.
Treat supplied playbooks as hypotheses, not proven results or mandatory defaults.
Verify platform behavior, policy, pricing, and benchmarks before
using them in a current plan.

## Start here

1. Read the nearest repository `AGENTS.md`, product status, and the smallest
   relevant app, analytics, subscription, and App Store files.
2. Establish the requested mode:
   - **audit**: diagnose the product, funnel, measurement, or economics;
   - **plan**: produce a staged growth plan and experiment manifest;
   - **prepare**: draft requested local changes, creatives or campaign settings
     and run local checks, without publishing or spending;
   - **review**: reconcile supplied results and recommend a bounded next action;
   - **implement**: make explicitly requested app-side instrumentation or
     funnel changes;
   - **operate**: change provider or ad-platform state only with explicit
     authorization, an exact account/app, and a hard spend cap.
   Default to planning when execution was not requested. Unset budgets do not
   block a useful proposal. Do not imply ongoing monitoring without an actual
   authorized scheduler. Monetization follows the product's job; subscriptions
   are not a requirement.
3. Read only the references needed for that mode:
   - Competitor teardown, organic distribution, or a compact single experiment:
     [competitor-to-experiment.md](references/competitor-to-experiment.md)
   - Product, App Store page, onboarding, paywall, pricing, and review:
     [product-and-funnel.md](references/product-and-funnel.md)
   - Events, attribution, experiment analysis, unit economics, and cash flow:
     [measurement-and-economics.md](references/measurement-and-economics.md)
   - Apple Ads or paid-social campaign design, creatives, stop rules, and
     scaling: [paid-acquisition.md](references/paid-acquisition.md)
   - Article provenance and claims that must remain hypotheses:
     [source-notes.md](references/source-notes.md)

## Operating invariants

- Start with user value and retention. Paid acquisition amplifies the existing
  funnel; it does not repair a weak or misleading product.
- Model the whole path: ad impression -> App Store page -> install -> onboarding
  -> paywall -> purchase -> renewal/refund. Name the current bottleneck before
  proposing changes.
- Compare acquisition cost with **net cohort value**, not list price, MRR, or
  gross revenue. Reconcile source definitions so taxes, store commission, and
  refunds are neither omitted nor subtracted twice.
- Use the provider-neutral event contract as the source of truth. Map it to the
  MMP, subscription system, analytics system, and ad network; do not let each
  vendor invent a conflicting taxonomy.
- Verify live event delivery and deduplication before optimizing for an in-app
  event. A dashboard mapping or queued postback is not proof of attribution.
- Prefer a small sequence of falsifiable experiments over simultaneous changes
  to the App Store page, onboarding, pricing, paywall, audience, and creative.
- Treat article numbers such as fixed prices, screen counts, conversion targets,
  budgets, creative spend, and percentage budget increases as starting
  hypotheses only. Use current product data and current first-party platform
  guidance.
- Preserve authorization boundaries. Planning never authorizes SDK installs,
  privacy-label changes, pricing changes, App Store submissions, provider setup,
  campaign creation, ad spend, or deployment.

## Workflow

1. **Build an evidence baseline.** Record the app and storefront, target user,
   core outcome, current acquisition channels, funnel counts by cohort, paid
   products, realized proceeds, refunds, renewals, attribution coverage, and
   data gaps. Label self-reported or inferred figures.
2. **Check readiness.** Confirm the product delivers ongoing value, purchase
   terms are clear, restore/manage-subscription paths work, privacy disclosures
   match every SDK, and the App Store page accurately represents the app.
3. **Choose one constraint.** Product-market fit, store-page conversion,
   onboarding completion, paywall conversion, retention, attribution quality,
   creative performance, or channel scale. Do not default to buying traffic.
   Check upstream audience/promise alignment before attributing a drop-off to
   the screen where it appears. More installs alone do not prove marketing worked.
4. **Define an experiment.** State the hypothesis, primary metric, guardrails,
   audience/cohort, control, changed variable, budget and loss cap, minimum
   observation rule, stop conditions, and decision rule before launch.
5. **Preview mutations.** Show the exact app files, provider fields, campaign
   settings, regions, creatives, schedule, and maximum spend. Stop for approval
   if the request did not already authorize those exact actions.
6. **Verify from end to end.** Use sandbox/test purchases where supported, then
   prove event arrival, mapping, revenue semantics, deduplication, attribution,
   and the user-visible purchase/restore/cancel experience.
7. **Evaluate cohorts.** Separate early conversion signal from mature renewal,
   refund, and net-value evidence. Scale, revise, or stop according to the
   precommitted decision rule; do not rationalize a losing test as an endless
   learning phase.

## Trust, policy, and quality

- Use current first-party Apple, ad-platform, MMP, and subscription-provider
  documentation at action time. Record the pages and access date in the plan.
- Never misrepresent outcomes, fabricate social proof or scientific authority,
  copy another app or creative 1:1, obstruct cancellation, hide material terms,
  or use false scarcity.
- Moderate spam, abuse, and harassment. Do not suppress legitimate criticism or
  filter words such as `cost`, `fake`, or `scam` merely to protect ROAS.
- A hard paywall is a product choice, not a default. It must be appropriate to
  the value delivered and still provide compliant purchase disclosure, restore,
  account, support, privacy, and subscription-management paths.
- Request tracking permission only when the actual data practice requires it;
  do not gate functionality on ATT consent or substitute another identifier to
  evade a refusal.
- Avoid medical, financial, religious, intimacy, addiction, or appearance-based
  positioning that exploits vulnerability. Require stronger evidence and a
  subject-matter review for high-stakes claims.

## Deliverable

Return the smallest useful artifact for the request. For a full plan include:

1. Current evidence and unknowns.
2. Funnel and unit-economics baseline with explicit definitions.
3. Ranked bottlenecks and why the first one wins.
4. One or more staged experiment manifests with spend/loss caps.
5. Required implementation or provider changes, separated by authorization.
6. Verification receipts and a scale/stop decision, when execution was asked.

Never report projected revenue, an enabled integration, campaign delivery, or
provider-reported conversions as realized profit.

For a focused review, return one decision—test, iterate, scale candidate, stop,
or insufficient evidence (hold for delayed data)—with at most five useful borrow/verify/avoid comparisons
and one next experiment. Use the compact reference above rather than expanding
every review into a full growth plan. Meaningful visual changes still require
`design-workflow` and owner selection; growth approval does not select a design.
For paid campaign reviews, use the more specific readiness/hold/stop/iterate/scale
decision rules in the paid-acquisition reference. A recommendation is not execution.
