# SaaS Maker public directory

## Direction

The public directory is a sunlit product workshop expressed as a black
steel-framed glass wall. Clear panes carry the studio story, seeded glass holds
supporting material, and three saturated panes—cobalt, amber, and oxblood—mark
work that deserves attention. The system should feel architectural and
handmade, not translucent app chrome.

## Color and material

- Limestone ground: `#eee8dc`
- Clear pane: `rgba(250, 247, 239, 0.88)`
- Seeded pane: `#ddd6c7`
- Steel: `#11120f`
- Ink: `#141511`
- Muted ink: `#5f5d55`
- Cobalt: `#1746a2`
- Amber: `#c9820d`
- Oxblood: `#7b211c`
- Pale line: `rgba(20, 21, 17, 0.2)`

Pane color is structural, not decorative. A saturated pane owns a whole
product or interaction state; do not scatter accent-colored text across the
page.

## Typography

Use Schibsted Grotesk throughout. Character comes from large, calm grotesque
type inside hard architectural proportions, not from switching to a display
serif. Keep display tracking above `-0.04em`, body copy at or above `1rem`, and
long prose near 70 characters.

The family is self-hosted, not loaded from Google Fonts. `public/fonts/`
carries the variable latin cut of the upstream v7 release, narrowed to the
400-750 weight range the system uses (44KB, SIL OFL, `OFL.txt` alongside it).
It is declared `font-display: optional` and preloaded, so a cold visit renders
in a metrics-matched Arial stand-in and never swaps mid-paint — the third-party
stylesheet used to land after first paint and make the hero heading both the
LCP and the page's only layout shift. Recut the file with the same weight range
and recompute the `size-adjust` / `ascent-override` / `descent-override`
numbers in `src/styles/globals.css` if the family is ever replaced; the
derivation is written out in the comment next to them.

## Layout

Compose public product discovery as a wall elevation. Matte-black mullions
separate unevenly proportioned panes; each pane carries one statement or
destination. The homepage first viewport is one clear editorial pane: a wide
headline sits beside the intro, status, and a masked glimpse of the atelier
photograph, and the spotlighted products arrive as a steel-mullioned ledger of
quiet plaques that flood with saturated pane color on hover and focus. The
ledger scales honestly to however many products are spotlighted — two read as
two commissioned entries, never as an unfinished grid. It does not repeat the
catalog: one directory gateway points to `/projects`, where supporting and past
work become disciplined specimen rows rather than cards.

Product detail pages inherit the same workshop world: one clear identity pane
shares a steel frame with a saturated canonical-product action, while public
evidence becomes a run of specimen panes. Ideas, Tools, and Learnings use the
same limestone ground, steel mullions, clear or seeded bays, and saturated
structural states while keeping the form each job needs: ledger, capability
register, or reading surface. On narrow screens, bays restack into one column
while preserving bar thickness and reading order. Legal pages remain quiet.

The changelog is the workshop ledger: a clear editorial pane shares the first
frame with one cobalt explanation pane, then dated milestones alternate seeded
date bays with quiet reading bays. Oversized ledger numbers expose chronology
without replacing semantic dates.

## Imagery

One editorial photograph of a real-feeling glazier's atelier supplies physical
light and depth. It remains atmosphere behind semantic HTML, never a rasterized
interface. Avoid generic abstract gradients, fake product screenshots, doodles,
and decorative glass blur.

## Motion

The wall arrives once: the editorial pane brightens, then the ledger plaques
settle in sequence. On the homepage, hover and focus flood a whole plaque with
its product's saturated color; elsewhere they backlight a pane without
translating the layout. Disable nonessential motion under
`prefers-reduced-motion`.
